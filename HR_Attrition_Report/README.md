# HR Attrition Excel Report

This repository contains an **HR Attrition Excel Report** that I have created as part of my data analysis journey. The report is based on a public dataset, and I have followed a general project tutorial from YouTube while adding my personal touch to personalize the final work.

## Background

By leveraging the power of Excel, I have used Power Query functions to clean the data and perform calculations prior to analyzing it.
